/* Day 1 - Syntax

/* styles-scss.css

    This is the file generated by styles-scss.scss,
    using the newer syntax.

    As you can see, this comment is shown in the CSS output because
    it uses the normal CSS syntax.
    The comments that use a double slash (//) are not being outputed
    in the CSS file.

// Here's some sample code written using Sass syntax.
    And this is a comment that will not show up in the
    final CSS file.
